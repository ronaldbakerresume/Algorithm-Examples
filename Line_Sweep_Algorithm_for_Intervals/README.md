# **Maximum Overlapping Intervals**

This project implements an algorithm to find the **maximum number of overlapping intervals** using event sorting. The goal is to determine the maximum number of intervals that overlap at any given point in time.

---

## **Problem Description**

Given:
- A set of intervals, where each interval has a start and an end time.

Goal:
- Determine the maximum number of intervals that overlap.

### **Example Input**

```plaintext
Intervals: [(1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 6), (5, 8), (7, 9)]
```

### **Expected Output**

```plaintext
Maximum Overlapping Intervals: 3
```

---

## **How It Works**

### **Algorithm**

1. **Event Representation:**
   - Represent each interval as two events:
     - Start of the interval: \(+1\)
     - End of the interval: \(-1\)

2. **Sort Events:**
   - Sort the events by time.
   - If two events have the same time, prioritize the end event over the start event to avoid over-counting overlaps.

3. **Sweep Line Technique:**
   - Traverse the sorted events and maintain a running count of overlapping intervals:
     - Increment the count for a start event.
     - Decrement the count for an end event.
   - Track the maximum count during the traversal.

---

## **Code Details**

### **Key Components**

1. **Event Creation:**
   - Convert intervals into start and end events:
     ```cpp
     for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
         events.push_back({interval.start, 1});  // Start of interval
         events.push_back({interval.end, -1});   // End of interval
     }
     ```

2. **Sorting Events:**
   - Sort events by time. Break ties by prioritizing end events:
     ```cpp
     sort(events.begin(), events.end());
     ```

3. **Sweep Line Algorithm:**
   - Count overlaps as events are processed:
     ```cpp
     int maxOverlap = 0, currentOverlap = 0;
     for (const auto& event : events) {
         currentOverlap += event.second;
         maxOverlap = max(maxOverlap, currentOverlap);
     }
     ```

4. **Main Function:**
   - Defines the input intervals and calls the `maxOverlappingIntervals` function:
     ```cpp
     int main() {
         vector<Interval> intervals = {{1, 3}, {2, 5}, {4, 6}, {5, 8}, {7, 9}};
         cout << "Maximum Overlapping Intervals: " << maxOverlappingIntervals(intervals) << endl;
         return 0;
     }
     ```

---

## **How to Run**

### **Requirements**
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)

### **Steps**
1. Copy the code into a file named `max_overlapping_intervals.cpp`.
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ max_overlapping_intervals.cpp -o max_intervals
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./max_intervals
   ```

---

## **Input/Output**

### **Input**
The program uses the following hardcoded intervals:
```plaintext
Intervals: [(1, 3), (2, 5), (4, 6), (5, 8), (7, 9)]
```

### **Output**
```plaintext
Maximum Overlapping Intervals: 3
```

## **Complexity**

### **Time Complexity**
1. **Event Creation:** \(O(n)\)  
   - Where \(n\) is the number of intervals.
2. **Sorting Events:** \(O(n \log n)\)
3. **Sweep Line Traversal:** \(O(n)\)

**Overall Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\)

### **Space Complexity**
- \(O(n)\): For the events array.

## **Applications**

1. **Scheduling Problems:**
   - Find the maximum number of simultaneous meetings or tasks.

2. **Traffic Analysis:**
   - Determine peak congestion periods based on entry and exit times.

3. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Calculate the number of resources required to handle overlapping tasks.

4. **Event Planning:**
   - Identify times with the most overlapping events.

---

## **Customization**

- Modify the `intervals` variable in the `main()` function to test with different datasets.

---

## **Advantages**

1. Efficient handling of overlapping intervals.
2. Simple implementation using sorting and the sweep line technique.

---

## **Limitations**

- Assumes all intervals are closed intervals \([start, end]\).
- Ties between events rely on correct sorting (end events before start events).

---

This implementation efficiently computes the maximum overlap among intervals, making it ideal for a variety of scheduling and resource management applications.
