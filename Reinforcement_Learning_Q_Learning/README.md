# **Q-Learning Implementation**

This project implements the **Q-Learning algorithm**, a foundational **Reinforcement Learning** technique. The goal is to train an agent to navigate a grid environment using learned Q-values for state-action pairs.

---

## **Overview**

**Q-Learning** is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. It learns the optimal policy by iteratively updating Q-values based on the Bellman equation.

The main components of Q-Learning include:
1. **States:** Represent the positions in the environment.
2. **Actions:** Define the possible moves (e.g., left, right).
3. **Q-Values:** Store the learned value for each state-action pair.
4. **Rewards:** Immediate feedback from the environment for taking an action.

---

## **Algorithm**

### **Steps**
1. **Initialize:**
   - Q-values are initialized to zero.
2. **Training:**
   - For each episode:
     - Start at a random state.
     - Take an action (exploration vs. exploitation).
     - Receive a reward and observe the next state.
     - Update the Q-value for the state-action pair.
3. **Convergence:**
   - The Q-values converge to optimal values after sufficient iterations.

---

## **Code Details**

### **Key Variables**
- `N`: Size of the grid environment.
- `alpha`: Learning rate (how quickly Q-values are updated).
- `gamma`: Discount factor (importance of future rewards).
- `epsilon`: Exploration rate (probability of choosing a random action).

### **Key Functions**
1. **`qLearning`:**
   - Trains the Q-values through episodes of interaction with the environment.
   ```cpp
   void qLearning(vector<vector<double>>& Q) {
       srand(time(0));
       for (int episode = 0; episode < 1000; ++episode) {
           int state = rand() % N;
           while (state != N - 1) {
               int action = (rand() % 2) ? (state + 1) : max(0, state - 1);

               int reward = (action == N - 1) ? 100 : -1;

               Q[state][action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * Q[action][action] - Q[state][action]);

               state = action;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **`main`:**
   - Initializes the Q-table and calls the Q-learning function.
   - Outputs the learned Q-values.
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       vector<vector<double>> Q(N, vector<double>(N, 0.0));
       qLearning(Q);

       cout << "Learned Q-Values:\n";
       for (const auto& row : Q) {
           for (double q : row) {
               cout << q << " ";
           }
           cout << endl;
       }
       return 0;
   }
   ```

## **How to Run**

### **Requirements**
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).

### **Steps**
1. Save the code to a file named `q_learning.cpp`.
2. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ q_learning.cpp -o q_learning
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./q_learning
   ```

---

## **Input/Output**

### **Input**
The algorithm does not require external input. The grid size, learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate are predefined in the code.

### **Output**
- Learned Q-values for each state-action pair:
  ```plaintext
  Learned Q-Values:
  0 2.3 0.0 ...
  1 4.2 1.1 ...
  ...
  ```

---

## **Theory**

### **Q-Value Update Rule**
\[
Q(s, a) \gets Q(s, a) + \alpha \left( r + \gamma \max_a Q(s', a) - Q(s, a) \right)
\]

Where:
- \(Q(s, a)\): Current Q-value for state \(s\) and action \(a\).
- \(r\): Reward for taking action \(a\) in state \(s\).
- \(\alpha\): Learning rate.
- \(\gamma\): Discount factor.

### **Exploration vs. Exploitation**
- **Exploration:** Taking random actions to discover new strategies.
- **Exploitation:** Choosing the best-known action based on current Q-values.

---

## **Applications**
1. **Game AI:** Training bots for games like chess, tic-tac-toe, or grid-world games.
2. **Robotics:** Path planning and navigation.
3. **Optimization:** Solving decision-making problems in dynamic environments.

---

## **Limitations**
1. **Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff:**
   - Balancing exploration and exploitation is crucial for convergence.
2. **Large State Space:**
   - Q-learning can be inefficient for large or continuous state spaces.
3. **Reward Design:**
   - Poorly designed rewards can lead to suboptimal policies.

---

## **Enhancements**
- **Dynamic Exploration Rate:**
  Gradually decrease \(\epsilon\) over time to reduce exploration as the agent learns.
- **Deep Q-Learning:**
  Extend the algorithm using neural networks to handle large state spaces.
